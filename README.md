# ABASI-PATHOS-clone
The Abasi Pathos is a modern high-gain distortion pedal designed by guitarist Tosin Abasi and Horizon Devices. This project is an open-source clone that reverse-engineers the circuit for educational purposes and DIY builders.
This pedal features a three-band active EQ, dual-stage clipping circuit, and tight low-end response designed for modern progressive metal tones. The design uses through-hole components where possible to make it accessible for beginners while maintaining the sonic characteristics of the original.
Key Features:

Adjustable gain structure with asymmetrical clipping
Active 3-band EQ (Bass/Mid/Treble)
High input impedance JFET buffer
True bypass switching
Standard 9V center-negative power
